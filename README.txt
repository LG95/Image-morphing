To run the program, use 'python main' with a single commandline argument. The PIL library is required.

This code was developed on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS and its default python verion (2.7.x) is the most compatible. Pypy 4.0.1 was also used during development and is compatible.

The files used by this program have been hardcoded into it as well as the features corresponding to them.

The single argument is a number, indicating how many frames to generate when morphing between the two images.
